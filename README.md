# Enrollment-Form
This form is designed to collect necessary information from students who are enrolling in programs or courses.

The HTML structure of the enrollment form includes input fields for capturing various information, such as name, address, contact details, and a file input field for uploading a photo. CSS is used to style the form, including the layout, fonts, colors, and other visual elements, to create an attractive and professional appearance.
JavaScript is utilized to add interactivity and functionality to the enrollment form. For instance, JavaScript can be used to validate input fields, ensuring that the required information is provided in the correct format. JavaScript can also be used to display preview images of the uploaded photo, allowing users to confirm their selection before submitting the form. Additionally, JavaScript can handle form submissions, sending the user's information and uploaded photo to a server for processing and enrollment.
